# Cluedo Game - Prolog

## Description
This project is a Prolog-based implementation of the classic board game **Cluedo** (or Clue). The objective is to solve the murder mystery by deducing:
1. **Who committed the murder** (Suspect)?
2. **What weapon was used** (Weapon)?
3. **In which room the murder occurred** (Room)?

The game is interactive, allowing players to move characters between rooms, make suggestions, and explore the mansion to uncover the solution.
